  [ðŸ“¸] Modern Instagram clone. (NextJS + Firebase)
</p>

<br/><br/>
## Project
This project was aimed at getting comfortable with NextAuth, Firebase, and Recoil state management. It consists of an authentication page, where the user can sign in using their Google account, after which they are redirected to the home page.

<br/><br/>
The home page is an exact copy of the Instagram home page. The system is a bit simplified however, so all posts in the feed are global posts. The stories and suggestions are filled with random Faker.js data to provide a realistic look and feel.

The user can create a new post by clicking on the 'Explore' icon in the navigation bar. They will be greeted by a modal that allows the user to upload a photo and attach a caption:

  After providing a photo and a caption, the post can be created using the 'Upload' button:

</p>

<br/><br/>
After uploading, the post gets added immediately and now shows up in the user's feed. Posts can be liked, and users can leave comments:
